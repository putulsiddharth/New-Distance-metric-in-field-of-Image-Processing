Inverse Hyperbolic Sine Distance:

Suppose there are two size features as feature vectors namely x ad y then our new Distance metrics is given by:

 sinh−1 (abs(Σ(xi-yi)))


SOFTWARE USED:
MATLAB 2019r

How to run:
Download the given folder and unzip it in the desired location
1)	Open matlab 2019r 
2)	Open all the file with .m extension in the given folder
3)	Run each file
4)	Run each opened file one by one and compare the time complexity shown in the Command window
5)	Get the inference and close all files and matlab 


In zip file there is a folder named as "code". In that folder we tested our formula on size feature and auto correlogram feature in terms of its performance and time complexity against existing formula like euclidean distance, manhattan distance etc.
